Project Title:

Student Timetable Manager (Python GUI Application)

1. Problem Statement

Students often have difficulty maintaining an organized class timetable, especially when schedules change frequently or when managing multiple subjects. Traditional handwritten timetables can become messy, misplaced, or require constant rewriting.
There is a need for a simple digital tool that allows students to quickly record, update, and view their daily schedule through an easy-to-use interface.
